"""
    The "decode" function begins by taking a file path as input and returns a list of decoded words, 
    which is unpacked as a string. The function reads the specified file, and storing its content into a 
    list named "pyramid_lines" using file.readlines().

    Using dictionary comprehension, I create a dictionary mapping numbers to words from the file data. 
    It splits each line into two parts and converts the first part to an integer, serving as the dictionary key. The 
    second part, with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, becomes the dictionary value.

    Initially considering a brute-force approach to generate pyramid numbers as a list of lists, the function 
    later recognizes a more efficient pattern: 1, 3, 6, 10, forming an arithmetic progression. This leads to the 
    adoption of the formula (n * (n + 1)) // 2.

    The function determines the maximum key in the dictionary and calculates its length to ascertain the number of 
    pyramid numbers required. An empty list, "final," is initialized to store the decoded words.

    The "while" loop iterates through triangular numbers, using the "find_pyramid" function. It appends 
    corresponding words to "final" if they meet specified conditions. The loop terminates when "start" exceeds 
    the number of key-value pairs.

    The decoded words are printed in a formatted string using print(*final). The function returns the "final" list. 
    In the if name == 'main': block, the function is invoked with the file path "t2.txt" to illustrate its 
    functionality.
